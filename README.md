## About The Project
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I used Flickr.com and Google map APIs for images and map loading.


## How  to Run

* clone the repository git clone 
* change working directory cd directory_name
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
The project will open at  http://localhost:3000.
